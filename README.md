DogecoinEV (DEV) White Paper

Welcome to DogecoinEV (DEV) - a high-speed, meme-friendly Layer 1 blockchain optimized for big blocks, fren-to-fren transactions, and merge mining. Inspired by the best parts of Dogecoin and Pepecoin, DogecoinEV aims to bring fun, simplicity, and scalability back to crypto—fully in line with a vision for a future where crypto is fast, inclusive, and unstoppable.

Abstract

DogecoinEV (DEV) is not just another fork—it’s an evolution, a movement, a vision of what blockchain should be: fast, fun, and limitless. By increasing block size, leveraging merge mining, and embracing a truly decentralized ethos, DogecoinEV ensures that everyone—yes, even normies—can be part of the future while still appealing to seasoned veterans of the crypto space.

Introduction

Think of DogecoinEV as Dogecoin, but optimized for scale and speed. We took what works, supercharged it, and now DEV is ready to send transactions at hyperspeed, delivering a high-throughput, meme-friendly chain. Launched with a genesis block timestamped "Nintondo" on December 6, 2013 (Unix 1386325540), DEV blends technical prowess with the playful spirit of its predecessors.

Quick Highlights
- Bigger Blocks, More Data, More Fun: 10MB blocks allow for more transactions, more memes, and more possibilities.
- Prefix D: Addresses start with D (base58 prefix 30), preserving that iconic Dogecoin flair.
- BIP Activation: BIP65 and BIP66 at block 1,000, BIP34 at 1,034,383—integrated early to keep the chain evolving.
- Fren-to-Fren (DEVS) Transactions: A currency made for sharing, tipping, and having a good time.
- Merge Mining: Earn while mining Dogecoin and Litecoin, starting at block 30,000 with chain ID 0x50—boosting security and efficiency.
- One-Minute Block Times: 60-second targets (nPowTargetSpacing = 60)—instant feels, instant confirmations.
- Scrypt Proof-of-Work: Keeping mining decentralized with N=1024, r=1, p=1—just how we like it.

DEV is built to scale and designed to keep the original fun-loving spirit of Dogecoin alive—taking it to the next level.

Core Features

Layer 1 Blockchain
DogecoinEV isn’t a token. It’s the real deal—a full-fledged, self-sustaining blockchain built for speed and efficiency.

Scrypt Proof-of-Work
Mining should be fair, open, and rewarding. DEV sticks with Scrypt (N=1024, r=1, p=1), meaning if you can mine Dogecoin, you can mine DogecoinEV. Difficulty adjusts every block (nPowTargetTimespan = 60) for stability.

10 MB Block Size – More Room for Transactions
Bigger blocks mean more transactions, lower fees, and room for innovation.
- Say goodbye to congestion.
- Say hello to fren-speed transactions that get confirmed fast.
- More space (10MB serialized, 5MB base, 160,000 sigops) means more possibilities—from NFTs to decentralized applications.

Merge Mining (AuxPoW) – Double the Rewards, Double the Fun
Activated at block 30,000 (nAuxpowStartHeight = 30000), DEV allows you to mine DogecoinEV alongside Dogecoin and Litecoin with no extra effort. Chain ID 0x50 (80) ties it into the Scrypt ecosystem securely.

Designed for Real People
- Easy-to-Use Core Wallet: Send and receive DEV with a click using the Qt-based GUI.
- Low Fees: No one likes paying extra—fees stay stupid low at 1 DEV/kB with DEV’s efficient block structure.
- Fast Confirmations: One-minute blocks keep everything moving at meme speed.

Chain ID
- DogecoinEV Chain ID: 0x50 (80)—unique and merge-mining ready.

BIP Features Activated
To ensure the chain stays agile, key Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) activate at specific heights:
- Block 1,000: BIP65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) and BIP66 (strict DER signatures).
- Block 1,034,383: BIP34 (height in coinbase)—timely upgrades for future expansions.

Tokenomics – Keeping It Fair

Block Rewards Schedule
| Block Range     | Reward Per Block (DEV)                            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0–99,999        | 500,000 (first 1k blocks random rewards up to 1M) |
| 100,000–144,999 | 250,000                                          |
| 145,000–199,999 | 125,000                                          |
| 200,000–299,999 | 62,500                                           |
| 300,000–399,999 | 31,250                                           |
| 400,000–499,999 | 15,625                                           |
| 500,000+        | 10,000                                           |

Predictable, Sustainable, Inflation Model
DogecoinEV keeps the proven inflationary model of Dogecoin, ensuring continuous mining rewards and low fees. Rewards halve every 100,000 blocks (nSubsidyHalvingInterval = 100000), roughly 69 days, with no artificial supply caps—just a steady flow of coins (~5.256M DEV/year at 10,000/block) to keep the network moving. Genesis starts at 88 DEV, then scales up.

Technical Specs & Upgrades

What Makes DogecoinEV Unique?
- 10MB Blocks: Making room for more transactions, more data, and more future possibilities (MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE = 10000000, MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 5000000).
- Merge Mining Activated at Block 30,000: Because security matters—chain ID 0x50.
- Optimized for Fast Transactions: Nobody likes waiting—one-minute blocks keep things moving.
- Custom GUI: A slick, user-friendly Qt wallet for everyone, from crypto OGs to total normies.
