DogecoinEV (DEV) White Paper 1.2
**Published: 4/8/2025**

---

## Welcome to DogecoinEV (DEV)

DogecoinEV (DEV) is a high-speed, meme-empowered Layer 1 blockchain designed for a world that needs *more throughput, more fun, and more freedom*. Inspired by the most iconic meme coins‚Äî**Dogecoin** and **Pepecoin**‚Äîand infused with the forward-thinking vision of Elon Musk for high-throughput, decentralized financial infrastructure, DEV is what happens when speed meets community and scale meets simplicity.

---

## Abstract

DogecoinEV (DEV) is not a mere fork‚Äîit‚Äôs a leap forward. DEV embodies the ethos of open-source community-driven development, optimized for modern needs and internet culture. Through *big blocks*, *merge mining*, and a playful yet powerful design, DEV brings you a chain that‚Äôs capable of handling real-world demand, meme-level virality, and a permissionless future.

Rooted in the original Dogecoin spirit but elevated with the throughput potential of visionary thinking‚Äîyes, we're talking Elon's dream of a super-efficient, frictionless crypto rail‚ÄîDEV is built for everyone. Whether you're a miner, a creator, or just a fren with a wallet, DEV welcomes you.

## Introduction

DogecoinEV is what Dogecoin could be if reimagined for the next era of crypto. It takes the accessibility and culture that made Dogecoin a household name and upgrades it with speed, efficiency, and scale.

With one-minute blocks, 10MB max block size, and the power of **merge mining**, DEV is engineered to thrive in a high-throughput environment. Transactions move fast. The network stays light. And fees? Practically non-existent.

Launched with a genesis block timestamped ‚Äú**Nintondo**‚Äù on December 6, 2013 (Unix 1386325540), DEV blends nostalgic roots with forward momentum. And with every block, it gets closer to realizing Elon‚Äôs vision: **a world where decentralized currency is instant, global, and unstoppable**.

---

## Key Highlights

- **High Throughput Design**: With 10MB serialized blocks and optimized Scrypt PoW, DEV can handle thousands of transactions per minute‚Äîmaking it ready for mainstream adoption, gaming, tipping, NFTs, and more.
- **Merge Mining**: Seamlessly earn DEV alongside Dogecoin and Litecoin‚Äîno extra electricity or hassle required.
- **Fren-to-Fren (DEVS) Transactions**: Send value to your frens in under a minute with DEVS‚Äîthe native, fun-loving coin of the DogecoinEV ecosystem.
- **Elon-Inspired Infrastructure**: Speed, simplicity, and throughput‚Äîall core to Elon‚Äôs vision for blockchain tech.
- **Minimal Fees, Maximum Fun**: With base fees set at 1 DEV/kB and ample space in each block, congestion becomes a thing of the past.
- **Meme-Friendly but Real**: From NFTs to actual commerce, DEV is as practical as it is playful.

## Core Features

### üîó Layer 1 Blockchain

DogecoinEV isn‚Äôt a token. It‚Äôs a fully-fledged blockchain built from the ground up with performance in mind. The foundation is solid, allowing developers to build real utility while maintaining a vibrant, expressive culture.

### üí• Scrypt Proof-of-Work

DEV utilizes **Scrypt PoW** (N=1024, r=1, p=1)‚Äîa time-tested algorithm shared by Dogecoin and Litecoin. This choice ensures fair mining and wide accessibility across existing hardware. With difficulty adjusting every block (`nPowTargetTimespan = 60`), DEV remains stable and adaptive to network conditions.

### üì¶ 10 MB Blocks ‚Äì No Congestion Here

Why 10MB blocks? Because the future demands throughput. Each block accommodates:
- 10MB serialized size
- 5MB base size
- 160,000 sigops

That‚Äôs more room for transactions, NFTs, app data, and even experimental features‚Äîall with lightning-fast confirmation times.

### ‚öíÔ∏è Merge Mining (AuxPoW)

Enabled at block 30,000 (`nAuxpowStartHeight = 30000`), merge mining allows miners to **simultaneously secure DogecoinEV and other Scrypt-based chains**, like Dogecoin and Litecoin. With Chain ID `0x50`, DEV ties into the broader Scrypt ecosystem, enhancing both **security** and **profitability**.

### üß† Elon‚Äôs Vision: Built-In

We took inspiration from Elon Musk‚Äôs belief in a world where crypto just works‚Äîfast, scalable, and accessible to everyone. DogecoinEV was designed from the start to:
- **Scale throughput** without layer 2 gimmicks.
- **Minimize latency**, thanks to 1-minute block times.
- **Maximize usability**, keeping UX normie-friendly.
- **Embrace memes**, because the internet runs on culture.

DEV is the meme-speed backbone for tomorrow‚Äôs Web.
