DogecoinEV (DEV) White Paper  
Version 1.2 – Published: 4/8/2025  
Launch Date: January 26, 2025  

======================================================
Welcome to DogecoinEV (DEV)
======================================================

DogecoinEV (DEV) is a high-speed, meme-empowered Layer 1 blockchain designed for a world that demands more throughput, more fun, and more freedom. Built from the best of Dogecoin and Pepecoin, and deeply inspired by Elon Musk’s vision for high-throughput decentralized infrastructure, DEV is where memes meet real scalability.

It’s fast. It’s fun. It’s built to handle thousands of transactions per minute. And it’s completely community-driven.

======================================================
Abstract
======================================================

DogecoinEV isn’t just another chain—it’s a movement. A high-throughput, meme-friendly, merge-mineable evolution of Dogecoin designed to bring back what made crypto great: speed, inclusion, and energy.

By increasing block size, enabling merge mining, and implementing core BIPs early, DEV delivers a simple, scalable blockchain that’s ready for creators, frens, and full-blown memecoin degenerates alike.

Inspired by Elon Musk’s desire for an internet-native money with extremely low latency and infinite scale, DogecoinEV is built to serve as a fast, fair, and fun Layer 1 for the future.

======================================================
Introduction
======================================================

DogecoinEV launched with its genesis block on January 26th, 2025—timestamped “Nintondo” and built to scale from day one.

It’s Dogecoin with rocket fuel. Think faster confirmations, bigger blocks, and merge mining with Dogecoin and Litecoin. All of it wrapped in a meme-ready design, made to power everyday tipping, gaming, NFTs, and peer-to-peer transactions.

This is the chain for frens. This is the chain for throughput.

======================================================
Highlights
======================================================

- 10MB max block size (5MB base)
- 1-minute block time
- Merge mining enabled at block 30,000 (Chain ID 0x50)
- Prefix “D” for addresses, “J” for script
- Scrypt Proof-of-Work (N=1024, r=1, p=1)
- Instant transactions, minimal fees
- Early BIP activation (BIP34, BIP65, BIP66)
- Low-fee design: 1 DEV/kB
- Full Qt-based core wallet
- Fren-to-fren currency: DEVS
- Fun-first culture, serious scalability

======================================================
Core Technology
======================================================

>> Layer 1 Blockchain  
DogecoinEV is not a token. It’s a self-contained blockchain with its own consensus, supply, and network.

>> Merge Mining  
DEV supports AuxPoW, so miners can earn DOGE, LTC, and DEV at the same time—maximizing efficiency and securing the chain.

>> Elon’s Throughput Dream  
DogecoinEV aligns with Elon Musk’s vision: high-volume, internet-native money that works at scale. Every protocol decision prioritizes speed and simplicity.

>> 10MB Blocks  
More data. More memes. More possibilities. 10MB serialized blocks = thousands of transactions per block. 160,000 sigops for on-chain logic.

>> Scrypt PoW  
Simple, secure, and fair. If you can mine Dogecoin, you can mine DEV. Difficulty adjusts every block for stability (nPowTargetTimespan = 60).

======================================================
Chain Parameters
======================================================

Chain ID: 0x50 (80)  
Address Prefix: D (pubkey - 30), J (script - 22)  
Block Time: 60 seconds  
Block Size: 10MB (serialized), 5MB (base)  
SigOps Limit: 160,000  
Default Port: 42069  
Genesis Block Time: 1386325540  
Genesis Block Reward: 88 DEV  
AuxPoW Activation: Block 30,000

======================================================
BIP Activation
======================================================

- Block 1,000:  
  - BIP65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY)  
  - BIP66 (strict DER signatures)

- Block 1,034,383:  
  - BIP34 (height in coinbase)

======================================================
Tokenomics
======================================================

Rewards are inflationary and halve every 100,000 blocks (~69 days). Modeled after Dogecoin, but tuned for predictable, ongoing participation.

| Block Range     | Reward Per Block (DEV) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 0–99,999        | 500,000 (first 1k random to 1M) |
| 100,000–144,999 | 250,000                 |
| 145,000–199,999 | 125,000                 |
| 200,000–299,999 | 62,500                  |
| 300,000–399,999 | 31,250                  |
| 400,000–499,999 | 15,625                  |
| 500,000+        | 10,000                  |

Annual long-term emission: ~5.26M DEV  
Halving interval: 100,000 blocks (nSubsidyHalvingInterval)

======================================================
Use Cases
======================================================

- Instant Digital Payments  
  Meme-speed transactions with <1min confirmations and near-zero fees.

- Merge Mining Revenue  
  Triple mine DOGE, LTC, and DEV with no extra cost.

- On-Chain Fun  
  Tip creators, mint NFTs, power dApps, and build fren-centric games.

- Inclusive Finance  
  DEV isn’t about Wall Street. It’s for real people, using real coins, for real things.
