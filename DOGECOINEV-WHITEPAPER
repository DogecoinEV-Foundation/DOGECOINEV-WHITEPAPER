# DogecoinEV (DEV)

A high-speed, meme-friendly, **Layer 1 blockchain** optimized for big blocks, fren-to-fren transactions, and merge mining. Inspired by the best parts of **Dogecoin** and **Pepecoin**, DogecoinEV aims to bring fun, simplicity, and scalability back to crypto‚Äîfully in line with **Elon‚Äôs Vision** for a future where crypto is fast, inclusive, and unstoppable.

## Abstract

DogecoinEV (DEV) is not just another fork‚Äîit‚Äôs an evolution, a movement, a vision of what blockchain should be: fast, fun, and limitless. By increasing block size, leveraging merge mining, and embracing a truly decentralized ethos, DogecoinEV ensures that **everyone‚Äîyes, even normies‚Äîcan be part of the future** while still appealing to seasoned veterans of the crypto space.

## Introduction

Think of DogecoinEV as **Dogecoin, but optimized for scale and speed.** We took what works, supercharged it, and now **DEV** is ready to send transactions at hyperspeed, fully aligning with Elon‚Äôs dream of a high-throughput meme-friendly chain.

### Quick Highlights
- **Bigger Blocks, More Data, More Fun** ‚Äì 10MB blocks allow for more transactions, more memes, and more possibilities.
- **Prefix D** ‚Äì Addresses start with **D**, preserving that iconic Dogecoin flair.
- **BIP Activation at Block 1k** ‚Äì We‚Äôve integrated BIP features early, ensuring our chain can evolve.
- **Fren-to-Fren (DEVS) Transactions** ‚Äì A currency made for sharing, tipping, and having a good time.
- **Merge Mining** ‚Äì Earn while mining Dogecoin and Litecoin at the same time, boosting security and efficiency.
- **One-Minute Block Times** ‚Äì Because no one likes waiting. Instant feels, instant confirmations.
- **Scrypt Proof-of-Work** ‚Äì Keeping mining decentralized, just how we like it.

DEV is built to scale, and designed to keep the original fun-loving spirit of Dogecoin alive‚Äîwhile taking it to the next level.

Bigger blocks mean **more transactions, lower fees, and room for innovation.**
- Say goodbye to congestion.
- Say hello to **fren-speed transactions** that get confirmed fast.
- More space means **more possibilities**‚Äîfrom NFTs to decentralized applications.

### Merge Mining (AuxPoW) ‚Äì Double the Rewards, Double the Fun
Activated at **block 30,000**, DEV allows you to mine DogecoinEV **alongside Dogecoin and Litecoin, with no extra effort.**

### Designed for Real People

## Under the Hood: ChainParams

Below is a snippet from our `chainparams.cpp` illustrating how our network parameters are set:

```cpp
// Simplified excerpt from chainparams.cpp:

class CMainParams : public CChainParams {
public:
    CMainParams() {
        strNetworkID = "main";
        // BIP is activated at block 1000
        consensus.BIP65Height = 1000;
        consensus.BIP66Height = 1000;
        // Blocks up to 99,999 have 500k rewards, next block ranges halve accordingly
        consensus.nSubsidyHalvingInterval = 100000;
        // Scrypt PoW with 1-minute block times
        consensus.nPowTargetTimespan = 60;
        consensus.nPowTargetSpacing = 60;
        // Chain ID 63
        consensus.nAuxpowChainId = 0x63;
        // PubKey address prefix is 30 (which is 'D')
        base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS] = std::vector<unsigned char>(1,30);
        // Additional chain parameters...
    }
};
```
